Rolling 12 months log created with tibber_easee_peak_power_analyzer.py
for a freestanding house with 5 occupants outside Gothenburg (without PV installed).
Household that optimizes pure electric hot water heating using vvb_optimizer_connected.py

Script uses SMHI solar data to estimate value of a small (4.5kWp) PV setup. Incl VAT:
- 1759 kWh/year self use without battery storage system (or changed consumption pattern)
  Value for May 2024 - April 2025 is 1552 SEK (+965 SEK energy tax effect) (excl 0,6 SEK tax credit system to be scrapped)
- 3402 kWh/year self use with 7 kWh battery storage system (no changed consumption pattern)
  Value for May 2024 - April 2025 is 1565 SEK (+1867 SEK energy tax effect) (excl 0,6 SEK tax credit system to be scrapped)
  Battery cycles used in one year: 235
  Thus: Arbitrage is more valuable Oct - April

Yearly arbitrage savings from 7 kWh battery (one daily cycle without loss) May 2024 - April 2025 is 1673 SEK incl VAT.

Yearly saving from VVB optimizer and sensibo optimizer (excl EV) when compared to Vattenfall flat monthly rate is 2022 SEK May 2024 - April 2025 (highest saving Dec - Feb)
